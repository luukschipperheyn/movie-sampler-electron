# Movie Sampler Electron

Movie Sampler extracts sound effects from movies based on subtitle files
that have noise captions. It just samples the movie audio whenever the
subtitles say something in square brackets, parentheses or all caps like
[alarm beeping] or (agonized grunts) or INDISTINCT CHATTER.
